# Distributional Offline Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning with Neural Physics-Informed PDEs

This repository contains the implementation for reproducing the numerical experiments from "Distributional Offline Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning with Neural Physics-Informed PDEs" by Igor Halperin (2023). The code follows the methodology described in the paper and implements the training of DOCTR-L in linear-quadratic (LQ) control settings.
